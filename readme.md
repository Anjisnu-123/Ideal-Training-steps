# Model Training Step

## Objectives

1. What is the objective?
2. Data Source (Kaggle, UCI, etc.)
3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
4. Data Cleaning
5. Handling Missing Values
6. Outlier Detection
7. Model Training
8. Hyperparameter Tuning
9. K-fold Cross-Validation

## Notes

10. For time series, we have to keep retraining or reiterate all the model training steps.

### Additional Notes
- `ANN - Time Series`

## To-Do List

1. Pilot Project: Time Series
2. Cauchy Distribution vs. Normal Distribution
3. Linear Regression
4. Collinear - VIF
5. Assumptions
